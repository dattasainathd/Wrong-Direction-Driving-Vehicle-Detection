# Wrong-Direction-Driving-Vehicle-Detection

Requirements: Python and OpenCV should be installed

How to execute this code:

1. To execute code and not display any graphs:
command: python cv_final_project.py <video_file_name.MOV>
Output will displayed after the file ends executing
example: python cv_final_project.py leftcorrect_rightcorrect.MOV

2. To execute code and display all the graphs:
command: python cv_final_project.py <video_file_name.MOV> TRUE
Output will displayed after the file ends executing
example: python cv_final_project.py leftcorrect_rightcorrect.MOV TRUE

Note: I have written all of the image processing steps, it takes longer execution time than utilizing the function of OpenCV.
